\chapter{Lean and mathlib}

In this chapter we will discuss some general concepts about lean and its mathematical library mathlib. 

Lean itself is a programming language that is frequently used as a theorem prover. 
It was primarily developed by Leonardo de Moura who co-funded the Lean focused research organisation that has taken on the development for five years in 2023 \cite{LeanFRO2024}. 
The currently used version is called Lean 4.
More about the technical details of Lean 4 can be found in \cite{deMoura2021}.

Lean is known for its extensive mathematical library called \emph{mathlib} of which the development has been largely community driven. 
Its github repository has just over 300 different contributors and multiple new pull requests every day that get approved or rejected by the 28 maintainers. 

There have been multiple large formalizations based on mathlib. 
Here are two examples: 
In the \emph{Liquid Tensor Experiment}, a challenge given to the lean community by Peter Scholze, Johan Commelin, Adam Topaz and a number of other contributors formalised a theorem by Peter Scholze and Dustin Clausen from condensed mathematics \cite{Commelin2022}.
Floris van Doorn, Patrick Massot and Oliver Nash have formalised the existence of sphere eversions, a concept from differential topology, showing that geometric areas of mathematics can also be successfully formalised in lean \cite{vanDoorn2023}. 

There are also several large scale ongoing projects of which we present two examples again: 
Floris van Doorn is currently leading a a formalisation of a generalisation of Carleson's theorem, a theorem from fourier analysis, by Christoph Thiele and his group \cite{Becker2024}.
Additionally there is a project lead by Kevin Buzzard that aims to reduce the famous Fermat's Last Theorem to mathematical facts already known by mathematicians in the 1980s, a starting point similar to that of Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor, who first proved this theorem in 1995 \cite{Buzzard2024}.
