\subsubsection{Constructing the product}

We can now move on to discuss the correct version of remark \ref{rem:wrongproduct}. 
For the rest of the section let $X$, $Y$ be CW-complexes with families of characteristic maps $(Q_i^n \colon D_i^n \to X)_{n \in \bN, i \in I_n}$ and $(P_j^m \colon D_j^m \to Y)_{m \in \bN, j \in J_n}$. 
We want to show:

\begin{lem}
    There is a CW-structure on $(X \times Y)_c$ with characteristic maps $(Q_i^n \times P_j^m \colon D_i^n \times D_j^m \to (X \times Y)_c)_{n,m \in \bN,i \in I_n,j \in J_m}$.
    The indexing sets $(K_l)_{l \in \bN}$ are given by $K_l = \bigcup_{n + m = l}I_n \times J_m$ for every $l \in \bN$.
\end{lem}

This needs to be fixed! See lean code!

\begin{lem}
    $(X \times Y)_c$ has weak topology,
    i.e. $A \subseteq (X \times Y)_c$ is closed iff $(Q_i^n \times P_j^m)(D^{n + m}) \cap A$ is closed for all $n, m \in \bN$, $i \in I_n$ and $j \in J_m$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}~
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item["$\Rightarrow$"] Since $D^{n + m}$ is compact, its image is compact and therefore closed. As the intersection of two closed sets $(Q_i^n \times P_j^m)(D^{n + m}) \cap A$ is closed as well.
        \item["$\Leftarrow$"] We know by definition of the k-ification that $A$ is closed if for every compact set $C \subseteq X \times Y$ $A \cap C$ is closed in $C$.
        Take such a compact set $C$.
        The projections $\pr{1}{C}$ and $\pr{2}{C}$ are compact as images of a compact set. 
        By ? there are finite sets $E \subseteq \{e_i^n \mid n \in \bN, i \in I_n \}$ and $F \subseteq \{f_j^m \mid m \in \bN, j \in J_m \}$ s.t $\pr{1}{C} \subseteq \bigcup_{e \in E} e$ and $\pr{2}{C} \subseteq \bigcup_{f \in F} f$.
        Thus 
        \[C \subseteq \pr{1}{C} \times \pr{2}{C} \subseteq \bigcup_{e \in E} e \times \bigcup_{f \in F} f = \bigcup_{e \in E} \bigcup_{f \in F} e \times f.\] 
        So $C$ is included in a finite union of cells of $(X \times Y)_c$. 
        Therefore 
        \[A \cap C = A \cap \left (\bigcup_{e \in E} \bigcup_{f \in F} e \times f \right )\cap C = \left (\bigcup_{e \in E} \bigcup_{f \in F} A \cap (e \times f)\right ) \cap C\] 
        is closed since by assumption $A \cap (e \times f)$ is closed for every $e$ and $f$ and the union is finite. Thus $A \cap C$ is in particular closed in $C$.
    \qedhere
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
