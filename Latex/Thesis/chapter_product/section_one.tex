\section{K-spaces and the k-ification}

\begin{lem}
    Let $X$ be a k-space.
    Then the topologies of $X$ and $X_c$ coincide.
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}
    Let $X$ be an anti-compact T$_1$ space.
    Then $X_c$ has discrete topology.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $A \subseteq X_c$ be any set. We need to show that it is open. 
    By the definition of the k-ification it is enough to show that $A \cap C$
    is open in $C$ for every compact set $C \subseteq X$. 
    Since $X$ is anti-compact $C$ is finite.
    And by T$_1$ every finite set has discrete topology. 
    Thus $A \cap C$ is open in $C$ and $X_c$ has discrete topology.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
    Let $X$ be a non-discrete anti-compact T$_1$ space. 
    Then $X$ is not a k-space.
\end{cor}
